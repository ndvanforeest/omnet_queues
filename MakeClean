# This file is not intended to be used by most users. It can be safely
# removed. The reason for its existence is to easily clean up the
# directories before sending the queues package out to the community.

# To run it in a useful way, type:
# % make -f MakeClean clean
# 
# After the directories have been cleaned:
# cd ..
# tar cvfz queues.tgz --exclude *.svn queues/
