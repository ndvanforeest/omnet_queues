Files: multi server queue
Author: Nicky van Foreest

These files implement a multi-server fifo queue. The code is a
modification of the single-server fifo queue. I did not try to
implement the multi-server queue such that it is visually clear what
is going on in the simulation. This would be a tremendous overhead on
the CPU. Hence, to understand the difference with the single server
queue--without looking at the code--it is best to track job-ids. Then
you will find out that indeed a multi-server queue is active; for
instance, you can see that jobs do not always leave in the order in
which they arrived (which can never be the case in a single server
fifo queue.)
