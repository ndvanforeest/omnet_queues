Files: Blocking queues
Author: Nick Van Foreest.
Date: April, 16th, 2002.

Here we study the effect of blocking on the throughput of a network of
queues. When a system is full it informs the generator to stop
sending, and when there is room the system informs the generator
station to start sending again. I have not yet enabled the fifo
stations themselves to communicate among themselves so as implement
the blocking protocol between the fifo stations.
