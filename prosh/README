Files: Processor sharing queue
Author: Nicky van Foreest
Date: April, 19th, 2002

These files implement a processor sharing queue. The code is a
modification of the single-server fifo queue. It is not easy to show
graphically what happens inside the server node. Hence, I have not
tried to do this. Check the code to ensure that the processor sharing
queue is indeed implemented (hopefully).
